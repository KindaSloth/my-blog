Hello there, I'm Guilherme!

I'm a SWE at [Blockade Labs](https://twitter.com/BlockadeLabs), currently working on [Skybox](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/) and some other projects.

I'll write about some cool computer science stuff I like in this blog.

My Twitter DM is always open, so feel free to reach me anytime :)
